                through contracts with our police and sheriff's departments (thank you, Chuck Wright) as well as private businesses. The cameras take pictures of everyone who passes by and upload
                them to Flock's cloud servers. Then, with the power of AI, officers can instantly search through all the past data for the following: <br><br>Vehicles <a href="#references"><sup>[1][2]</sup></a>

            <h4>Unvetted surveillance tech is a national security risk</h4>
            <p>
                Flock is a private company contracting with the government. Their cameras are everywhere. If our enemies gained access to this 
                system, they would have the ultimate AI powered intel on us. So how secure is Flock's technology? <br><br>
                Thankfully, independent researchers have taken it upon themselves to evaluate offline cameras for vulnerabilities.<a href="#references"><sup>[11]</sup></a>
                They found 51. For example, one unit was running on an old version of Android that stopped getting support and security updates in 2022. <br><br>
                The food service industry, for example, has to have licenses and inspections. Flock is under no such oversight. The only security standards
                they are beholden to are the ones their executives set depending on how much overhead they're willing to spend.<br><br>

        <div class="flex-sec-cont">
            <h4 id="section-5">How Flock has already been abused</h4>
            <p>
                Here are three examples of Flock gone wrong. These are not isolated incidents, but rather an exhibit of systemic issues and
                lack of accountability and oversight: <br><br>
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li><b>Espanola, NM:</b> An innocent woman and her 12 year old sister were held at gunpoint, suspected of a stolen vehicle.
                    Flock LPR had misread a "2" for a "7."<a href="#references"><sup>[12]</sup></a>
                </li>
                <li><b>St. Augustine, FL:</b> A suspect attempted to kidnap a young woman from her place of work. A Flock alert sent police to an innocent man's apartment.
                    Meanwhile, the suspect was arrested in a routine traffic stop.<a href="#references"><sup>[13][14]</sup></a>
                </li>
                <li><b>Sedgewick, KS:</b> The Police Chief used Flock to stalk his ex. He did 228 searches over 4 months of her and her new boyfriend's cars.
                    He was caught by chance while under investigation for an unrelated misconduct case, not due to any auditing system.<a href="#references"><sup>[15]</sup></a> Good thing
                    we had Chuck Wright, the beacon of integrity, as our sheriff all these years...
                </li>
            </ul>
            <p>
                Inside of law enforcement offices is one thing, but what about other bad actors? Cybersecurity weaknesses were mentioned in
                the previous section, and one example of how this has already gone past hypotheticals is with the leak of officer credentials
                on the dark web.<a href="#references"><sup>[16]</sup></a> Flock does not require users to set up multi-factor authentication (MFA). Whoever purchased those Flock user
                credentials possibly has unfettered access to an AI powered nation-wide surveillance network.

        <div class="flex-sec-cont">
            <h4> We don't have to sacrifice freedom for safety</h4>
            <p> Here are a few examples of communities across the country who said "no" to mass surveillance by Flock and canceled or lapsed their contracts:<br><br> </p>
                <ul>
                    <li><b>Guthrie, OK</b> April 2025<a href="#references"><sup>[17]</sup></a></li>
                    <li><b>Austin, TX</b> June 2025<a href="#references"><sup>[18]</sup></a> - <a href="https://noalprs.org/">noalprs.org</a></li>

                </ul>
            <p>
                As you can see, anti-surveillance is a non-partisan issue. The Flock system could be used by the government to find
                people who aren't wearing their mask during a pandemic, or provide intel for ICE raids. The system could be used to search for cross
                and 2nd amendment bumper stickers, for rainbow and Palestine bumper stickers, for Clemson or Gamecocks stickers ;) Everyone has their reasons, and united we have the
                power to protect our freedom from government overreach. <br><br>
